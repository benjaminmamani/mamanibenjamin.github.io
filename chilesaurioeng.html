<h1>Chilesaurus</h1>
<p></p>
Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is the only known species of the extinct genus Chilesaurus of dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic,</br> 150-146 million years ago in what is now South America.
 Its fossils were discovered in the Aysén region, in Chile. At the time of its </br> description, it was considered one of the few known herbivorous theropods outside of coelurosaurs.​</br>
  It has an unusual combination of theropod, ornithischian, and sauropodomorph traits, so this genus has important </br> implications for understanding dinosaur evolution, such as the traditional saurischian-ornithischian division </br> or in support of the alternative proposal of the Ornithoscelida group.​ </br>
   According to fossils found in the Toqui Formation, Chilesaurus coexisted with other small theropods, basal crocodyliforms,</br> and both diplodocid and titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs. </br>

The first fossils of Chilesaurus, a vertebra and a rib, were discovered on February 4, </br> 2004 in the commune of Aysén by the —at that time— seven-year-old boy Diego Suárez, who</br> accompanied his parents, the geologists Manuel Suárez and Rita de la Cruz. New specimens were discovered in 2008</br>, but they were thought to belong to several different dinosaur species.4 It was only </br> later that they realized they belonged to the same species with a strange </br> combination of traits. In 2015, the type species, Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, was named and described</br> by the Argentine paleontologist Fernando Novas and his collaborators. The genus name does </br>
reference to Chile and the specific name honors Diego Suárez.

The holotype, SNGM-1935, was found in a layer of the Toqui Formation, dating to the late </br> Tithonian. It consists of a fairly complete and articulated skeleton of a juvenile individual, with the <br> skull, but lacking the feet and most of the tail. Paratypes have been established with other</br> four partial skeletons (specimens SNGM-1937, SNGM-1936, SNGM-1938, SNGM-1888)</br> and several individual bones (specimens SNGM-1889, SNGM-1895, SNGM -1901 SNGM-1894, SNGM-1898, </br> SNGM-1900 and SNGM-1903), which represent juvenile and adult individuals.1​In September 2017 the </br> holotype was transferred from Sernageomin, and today It is housed in the National Museum of Natural History </br> of Chile. Since November 2017, these fossil remains were exhibited for the first time to the public </br> in the temporary exhibition of the MNHN "Dinosaurs, beyond extinction". In the exhibition</br> the original fossil of Pelagornis chilensis was also shown. Other fragments of one of the </br> fossilized skeletons of the Chilesaurus (humerus and nail phalanx of the thumb) can be seen </br> in the regional permanent exhibition of the Regional Museum of Aysén in the city of Coyhaique.</br>
